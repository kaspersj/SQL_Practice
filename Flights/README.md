This Jupyter Notebook aims to explore the rich datasets first explored in my Stats306 repo, and replicate tables and calculations from undergraduate coursework. This exercise will also serve as practice for using SQL programming skills with DuckDB.
# Datasets:
 - nycflights13: A comprehensive dataset containing flight information for New York City airports in 2013.
 - bil: A dataset describing billionaires.
 - UCBAdmissions: This dataset contains graduate school admissions data from 1973 for six departments at UC Berkeley.
# Goal:
Practice SQL programming skills using DuckDB.
What is DuckDB?
DuckDB is a high-performance, in-memory analytical database that can be embedded directly into Python applications.It's designed to handle large datasets efficiently and offers an interface for SQL querying and manipulating data.
# Key Features and Benefits:
 -	High Performance: DuckDB is known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for data-intensive tasks.
 -	In-Memory Database: It operates entirely in memory, providing fast query execution times.
 -	SQL Interface: DuckDB uses a familiar SQL syntax, making it easy for developers to interact with the database.
 -	Python Integration: DuckDB can be seamlessly integrated into Python applications using the duckdb Python package.
 -	Flexibility: It supports various data types and operations, allowing for complex data analysis.
# Context for this Analysis:
 -	Flight Delays: Analyze the distribution of flight delays, showcase SQL data manipulation skills, and explore relationships with factors like weather, airlines, and airports.
 -	Airline Performance: Compare the performance of different airlines in terms of on-time arrivals, cancellations,and delays.
 -	Weather Impact: Investigate the impact of weather conditions on flight delays and cancellations.
